SpotMenu is a combination of [TrayPlay](https://github.com/mborgerson/TrayPlay) 
and [Statusfy](https://github.com/paulyoung/Statusfy) written entirely in swift.


How to Build
------------

First, you'll need Xcode. You can download this at the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
Second, you'll need [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). 

Now, use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository and clone the submodules.

    git clone https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu.git
    cd SpotMenu
    pod install

Finally, open up the SpotMenu.xcworkspace. Set the "Scheme" to build the SpotMenu target for "My Mac". Then Product > Run (or the shortcut ⌘R).
