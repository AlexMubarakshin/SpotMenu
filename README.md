## About

![demo](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu/blob/master/Demo/demo.gif)

SpotMenu is a combination of [TrayPlay](https://github.com/mborgerson/TrayPlay) 
and [Statusfy](https://github.com/paulyoung/Statusfy) written ~entirely~ _almost entirely_ in swift. 

Toast: <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>command</kbd> + <kbd>m</kbd>

## Notes

- The default behavior is to show the SpotMenu icon, Artist and Track title in the menubar. Right click ‚Üí Preferences to customize. ¬† ¬†
- The animated gif currently demonstrates the functionality of version 1.7

[List of all features](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu/blob/master/FEATURES.md)


## Easy Install

Download the zip file [version 1.7](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu/releases/download/v1.7/SpotMenu170.zip). Unarchive it. Run SpotMenu.app.
I do not have an Ô£ø developer account to sign the app with therefore you will most likely receive a warning that the app is from an unidentified developer. To open the app follow these [steps](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH25088?locale=en_US)!

You can find all releases [here](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu/releases).

## Advanced Install

via [Homebrew Cask](https://caskroom.github.io)

```sh
brew cask install spotmenu
```

## How to Build

First, you'll need Xcode 9. You can download this at the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
Second, you'll need [CocoaPods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html). 

Now, use [Git](http://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu.git
cd SpotMenu
pod install
```

Finally, open up the SpotMenu.xcworkspace. Set the "Scheme" to build the "SpotMenu" target for "My Mac". Then Product > Run (or the shortcut ‚åòR).

Note: 
- Version 1.7 has been updated to swift 4.0 therefore Xcode 9 is required.
- In some cases it might be required to select the "MusicPlayer" scheme and build it before selecting "SpotMenu".
- To fix "cannot find a team matching ..." error follow these [steps](https://github.com/kmikiy/SpotMenu/issues/54)
